        “Hi. My name is Rosella Blossum. I'm one of Samy's friends. I like planting flowers and sharing
        some of the flowers with others. Right now, I would like to share with the parents and teachers 
        about helping kids become engaged in the Samy Kind books. We have coloring pages that children 
        can color. We even have a few fun craft activities that we've done in the books. As we have formed 
        our kindness club, we would like you to form a book club based on our adventures together. You can 
        even teach them about the lessons we've learned and how they can imply in the long run of life.”
