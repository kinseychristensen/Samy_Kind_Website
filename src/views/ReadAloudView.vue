        <div class="avatar-intro">"Hi there. I'm Flicker Dragon, one of Samy's best friends. I like fire and heat, but I like it in careful ways, just 
        the way I like being confident about things in careful ways too. I'm confident to tell you that Mr. Nate has his
        own YouTube channel on read-alouds for each chapter of one book at a time. He has a very fluent voice when it comes
         to reading about us. He can do different voices and tones of how the story goes. He's a very exciting reader. I 
         confidently recommend hearing the way he reads. It's really entertaining.‚Äù
