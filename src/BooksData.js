        bookTitle: 'The Kind Family',
        description: 'This book is about the importance of family, and the hero is six-year-old Samy Kind. He is a boy who shows kindness to lots of people, but can he continue to be kind when he faces a major tragedy? Is being Kind more than a name? Samy travels through the stages of grief as he tires to deal with perhaps the most major change any child can face.',
        nateNotes:'I wrote this book because I have been taught that a lot of us face hard times that happen unexpectedly. Sometimes, when facing the challenges of life, we can either feel upset or sad, but that does not mean your life is not good. I lost my grandma when I was twelve and thought that as a child, I was to blame. But family members kept telling me it was just part of life and that the death of someone you truly love is not something to take responsibility for. I was even unaware about the five stages of grief as a child, but after my mom taught me about it, I thought it could be a good lesson and pattern for children to know that going through grief is part of life, but it does not have to be in your life all the time, because when it comes to being at the last stage of grief, you become happier before you know it.',

        bookTitle: 'Unconditional Love',
        description: 'This book is about how Samy Kind learns that love doesn’t have to be used in a way that other people expect nor does it have to be used on a crush that they might have. He learns that love can be involved with kindness as well, even if others don’t agree. Maybe the best place to really learn about love is right at home, with your family.',
        nateNotes: 'I wrote this book for a purpose that I did not understand as a child, but my family has shown it to me for all those years of my life. When I was in middle school, I accidentally said “I love you” to a girl in class and she was grossed out by that. I was so embarrassed and naive ever since that happened. I even felt embarrassed of saying it to my mom or dad. Ever since then, I never understood about love until I was at college and learned about the different kinds of love for a Family & Marriage Study Class. That’s when I encountered the term unconditional love, but thought I would teach that to kids who may not understand what love is until they take the time to listen to their families to learn about it. So remember, kids. Love doesn’t have to be romantic or flattering, but it has to be shown by care and support.',

        bookTitle: 'Special Orange Glasses',
        description: 'This book is about Samy and his friends meeting an autistic boy named Evan Smith. They try to cope with him, but have a hard time understanding him at first. Some of this story is based on Mr. Nate’s experiences as a child with autism, but it will be considered fiction, because the hero is Evan Smith and he will be in a pretend world.',
        nateNotes:'This was technically my first published book, because I did it for a Capstone project at Utah Valley University. The reason why I wrote this book is because it helped me not only understand my perspective of autism, but it also helped me to understand other people who may not have autism and to know what it’S like to be the other. Evan Smith is the character that describes my experiences in elementary school and Samy and his friends are described as the mainstream classmates I used to be around with, but misunderstood a lot of things, even when trying to help me out with simple tasks. I wrote this book to teach children what it is like to help a child with autism and how it can help them in their lives.',

        description: 'This book is about Samy and his friends forming a club for showing kindness to others. They end up going on a summer camping trip where they learn to not only show kindness to other people, but they also show it to animals as well.',
        nateNotes:'I wrote this book as a way of reminding children to always be kind to animals both wild and domestic. I also thought of it as one of the adventures that I had done at camp while I was in Boy Scouts. None of them ever involved encountering animal rescue missions, but they involved respecting the animals and the environment. And of course, as a child, I had a dog, but I was a little rusty with being patient and knowing how to take care of a dog. So after growing up and learning how to be patient and more responsible, I thought children ought to know about how it is important to show kindness to animals, because animals have feelings, just like humans do.',
